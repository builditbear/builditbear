- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon, AKA Build-It Bear! 
- 👀 I’m currently looking for job opportunities in Front End Web Engineering. I also have budding but largely unexplored interests in Mobile Development on Linux for Mobile Devices and iOS.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge of React and SASS/SCSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on virtually any open source project as a means to learn from my more experienced peers and become accustomed to coding on a team. I have excellent interpersonal skills coupled with an upbeat and patient attitude!
