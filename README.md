- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon, AKA Build-It Bear! 
- 👀 I’m currently looking for job opportunities in Java Desktop Development or Web Development. I also have budding but largely unexplored interests in Mobile Development on Linux for Mobile Devices and iOS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaFX, clean coding skills, and web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on virtually any open source project as a means to learn from my more experienced peers 
and become accustomed to coding on a team. I'm a bit shy about my code, but I have excellent interpersonal skills 
coupled with an upbeat and patient attitude. I'm an exceptional team player at my current job, but I have never worked on a 
*software engineering* team specifically.
