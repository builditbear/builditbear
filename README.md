- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon, AKA Build-It Bear! 
- 👀 I’m a UI Engineer with recent experience in many frameworks including Ember.js, React, and Angular, as well as a plethora of other front-end technologies. I also have budding but largely unexplored interests in Mobile Development on iOS and Linux. As a soft skill bonus, I come out-of-the-box with an upbeat, can-do attitude!
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge of Slack's Bolt API, Ember.js, and game development in Godot Engine
- 💞️ I love honing my web dev skills in Javascript/Coffeescript as well as SCSS. My long-term ambition is to someday be a UI engineer for Apple!
