- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon, AKA Build-It Bear! 
- 👀 I’m a Front-End Engineer with recent experience in many frameworks including Ember.js, Next.js, and Angular. As a soft skill bonus, I come out-of-the-box with an upbeat, can-do attitude!
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge of Next.js, TypeScript, and React as I've enjoyed the performance benefits and DX that these technologies have to offer. Very interested in better understanding some build systems and bundlers I've gained exposure to recently, such as Vite, Webpack, and Turbopack. I'm also brushing up on my low-level programming roots with C, and getting involved in some simple hardware projects with Arduino to get exposure to electrical engineering principles.
- 💞️ I love the idea that someone, somewhere, is using a product that I played some small part in making reality with a great, big smile on their face. I find that notion as humbling as it is satisfying :) As my knowledge of CS has deepened, I've developed an interest in writing embedded firmware for things like vehicles, robots, maybe even spaceships! I'd also like to contribute to my favorite FOSS projects as my computer systems expertise grows... so who knows where I'll end up!
