- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon, AKA Build-It Bear! 
- 👀 I’m a Front-End Engineer with recent experience in many frameworks including Ember.js, Next.js, and Angular. As a soft skill bonus, I come out-of-the-box with an upbeat, can-do attitude!
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge of Next.js, TypeScript, and React as I've enjoyed the performance benefits and DX that these technologies have to offer. Very interested in better understanding some build systems and bundlers I've gained exposure to recently, such as Vite, Webpack, and Turbopack. I'm also learning web design principles through Figma's online course so I can become more self-sufficient when building my own web apps!
- 💞️ I love the idea that someone, somewhere, is using a product that I played some small part in making reality with a great, big smile on their face. I find that notion as humbling as it is satisfying :) My dream until recently was to someday be a UI engineer for Apple, but I've developed an interest in writing firmware for robots and grown increasingly passionate about FOSS and startups like Framework that champion Right to Repair and user privacy...so who knows where I'll end up!
