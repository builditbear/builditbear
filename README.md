- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon, AKA Build-It Bear! 
- 👀 I’m currently looking for job opportunities in Front End Web Development, aiming to specialize in React web apps. I also have budding but largely unexplored interests in Mobile Development on iOS and Linux. As a soft skill bonus, I have excellent interpersonal skills coupled with an upbeat, can-do attitude!
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge of Ember, React, and SASS/SCSS.
- 💞️ I love honing my web engineering skills in Javascript and also enjoy opportunities to fashion elegant UIs through CSS. My long-term goal for now is to someday becaome a full-stack web developer once I've gotten more experience on the back end.
- 📫 You can reach me at brandon.nan.chavez@gmail.com or on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/builditbear/.
