- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon, AKA Build-It Bear! 
- 👀 I’m a Front-End Engineer with professional experience in the Ember.js and Next.js frameworks. I also have academic experience with Python, Java, and C/C++. As a soft skill bonus, I come out-of-the-box with an upbeat, can-do attitude!
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge of Next.js, TypeScript, and React as I've enjoyed the performance benefits and DX that these technologies have to offer. I'm currently looking to transition into a career as a ML engineer, and I've enrolled in a CS Masters program with a focus in ML/AI to that end. I'm also advancing my knowledge of back-end database and service technologies like Microsoft Azure, PostgreSQL, and container orchestration.
- 💞️ I love the idea that someone, somewhere, is using a product that I played some small part in making reality with a great, big smile on their face. I find that notion as humbling as it is satisfying :) Coming from a working background in Optometry, I became a software engineer hoping to make daily life more pleasant for providers and patients alike. In my free time, I enjoy Tennis, video games from strategy and roleplaying genres in particular, and cooking plant-based goodness for friends and family!
